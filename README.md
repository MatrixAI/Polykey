## What is Polykey?

**Polykey is an open-source, peer-to-peer system** that addresses the critical challenge in cybersecurity: **the secure sharing and delegation of authority**, in the form of secrets like keys, tokens, certificates, and passwords.

It allows users including developers, organizations, and machinesâ€”to **store these secrets in encrypted vaults on their own devices, and share them directly with trusted parties.**

* **All data is end-to-end encrypted**, both in transit and at rest, eliminating the risk associated with third-party storage.
* **Polykey provides a command line interface**, desktop and mobile GUI, and a web-based control plane for organizational management.
* By treating secrets as tokenized authority, it offers a fresh approach to **managing and delegating authority in zero-trust architectures** without adding burdensome policy complexity - a pervasive issue in existing zero-trust systems.
* Unlike complex self-hosted secrets management systems that require specialized skills and infrastructure, Polykey is **installed and running directly from the end-user device**.
* It is built to **automatically navigate network complexities** like NAT traversal, connecting securely to other nodes without manual configuration.

**Key features:**

* **Decentralized Encrypted Storage** - No storage of secrets on third parties, secrets are stored on your device and synchronised point-to-point between Polykey nodes.
* **Secure Peer-to-Peer Communication** - Polykey bootstraps TLS keys by federating trusted social identities (e.g. GitHub).
* **Secure Computational Workflows** - Share static secrets (passwords, keys, tokens and certificates) with people, between teams, and across machine infrastructure. Create dynamic (short-lived) smart-tokens with embedded policy for more sophisticated zero-trust authority verification.
* With Polykey Enterprise, you can create private networks of Polykey nodes and apply mandatory policy governing node behaviour.

Polykey is an open-source, peer-to-peer system that addresses the critical challenge in cybersecurity: the secure sharing and delegation of authority, in the form of secrets like keys, tokens, certificates, and passwords.

It allows users including developers, organizations, and machinesâ€”to store these secrets in encrypted vaults on their own devices, and share them directly with trusted parties.

All data is end-to-end encrypted, both in transit and at rest, eliminating the risk associated with third-party storage.

Polykey provides a command line interface, desktop and mobile GUI, and a web-based control plane for organizational management.

By treating secrets as tokenized authority, it offers a fresh approach to managing and delegating authority in zero-trust architectures without adding burdensome policy complexity - a pervasive issue in existing zero-trust systems.

Unlike complex self-hosted secrets management systems that require specialized skills and infrastructure, Polykey is installed and running directly from the end-user device.

It is built to automatically navigate network complexities like NAT traversal, connecting securely to other nodes without manual configuration.

Key features:

* Decentralized Encrypted Storage - No storage of secrets on third parties, secrets are stored on your device and synchronised point-to-point between Polykey nodes.
* Secure Peer-to-Peer Communication - Polykey bootstraps TLS keys by federating trusted social identities (e.g. GitHub).
* Secure Computational Workflows - Share static secrets (passwords, keys, tokens and certificates) with people, between teams, and across machine infrastructure. Create dynamic (short-lived) smart-tokens with embedded policy for more sophisticated zero-trust authority verification.
* With Polykey Enterprise, you can create private networks of Polykey nodes and apply mandatory policy governing node behaviour.

npm install
# build the dist
npm run build
# run the repl (this allows you to import from ./src)
npm run ts-node
# run the tests
npm run test
# lint the source code
npm run lint
# automatically fix the source
npm run lintfix
```

### Docs Generation
